# Lifesaver---SMC-T-3
This is project Lifesaver made by team SMC T-3
So, our project focuses to resolve the issue of the non-availability of hospital beds and the need to call every hospital to ask if beds are available. 
Everywhere on social media and websites, there is information regarding the availability of beds, 
but there is no one place where we can get all this so we collected as many verified sources as possible, 
and merged them into an app to help the ones in need.

The final app is still under contruction but we have made a demo app so you can get an idea of how the app will look
the link to download the demo app is giveen down -
